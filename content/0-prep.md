## Install Open Refine

Open Refine is a free, open source tool that is incredibly powerful. It will help you transform data, reconcile data, and even scrape data. 

Download it here: <https://openrefine.org/download.html>

Here's [a whole workshop by Evan on it](https://evanwill.github.io/openrefine-b/).

## Text Editor

When working with code you should have a good text editor.
Windows notepad does not handle UTF-8 encoding or UNIX line endings that are standard for cross platform applications. 
For basic editing, Windows [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), Mac TextEdit, or Linux Gedit are sufficient.
However, a more complete code editor will be helpful for managing our projects.

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
